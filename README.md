![boat gif](Docs/assets/images/boat.gif)
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Bataille Navale game, a Java implementation of the classic Battleship game using Swing for graphical user interface components. This project is designed to showcase advanced concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and introspection, along with robust error handling.

## 4 - Key Concepts

This project illustrates several key OOP concepts:

- **Introspection:** Utilizing Java's reflection capabilities to dynamically inspect classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Using superclass references to operate on objects of various subclasses.
- **Encapsulation:** Restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing comprehensive error handling throughout the game to manage runtime exceptions effectively.
- **GUI Development:** Employing Java Swing to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.
